      Antonio. In sooth, I know not why I am so sad: It wearies me; you say it
      wearies you; But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, What stuff 'tis
      made of, whereof it is born, 5 I am to learn; And such a want-wit sadness
      makes of me, That I have much ado to know myself.

      Salarino. Your mind is tossing on the ocean; There, where your argosies
      with portly sail, 10 Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, Or, as
      it were, the pageants of the sea, Do overpeer the petty traffickers, That
      curtsy to them, do them reverence, As they fly by them with their woven
      wings.
